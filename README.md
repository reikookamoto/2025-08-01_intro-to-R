## About 

In this workshop, we'll cover the basics of R syntax, introduce the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and explore commonly used functions and packages to help you get started with data analysis in R. We'll also walk through how to create Table 1s in a reproducible way using R. No prior programming experience is required.

If you'd like to code along during the session, please install R and RStudio ahead of time by following the instructions on the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
